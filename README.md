### pass_tutorial.ipynb

This tutorial notebook is designed as a multifaceted educational tool for my tutees, covering key concepts in physics. It combines theoretical explanations with practical Python implementations.

- **Key Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits`, `sympy`, `subprocess`
- **Functionality**:
  - Visualises a 3D vector field and its divergence, providing insights into vector calculus.
  - Demonstrates error propagation in chemical density calculations, highlighting the importance of precision in scientific measurements.
  - Interacts with external files (e.g., PDFs) for practical demonstrations of Python's versatility.
  - Quantum mechanics: Explores wave functions in quantum mechanics with visualisations of position and momentum space representations.

This notebook is an essential resource for PASS sessions, offering students hands-on experience with complex scientific concepts through interactive Python coding.
